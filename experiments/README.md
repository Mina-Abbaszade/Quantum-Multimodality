# Experiments

This directory contains experiment-specific configurations and scripts.

Experiments are organized according to:
- training stage (single-object vs relational)
- task (image–caption alignment vs relation classification)
- encoding method (angle, amplitude, MHE, MPS, etc.)

This structure mirrors the experimental setup reported in the paper.
