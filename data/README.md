# Data

This directory defines the expected dataset structure.

Due to size and licensing constraints, datasets are not included in this repository.

The data layout follows:
- single-object dataset (cube, cone, cylinder, sphere)
- relational dataset with spatial relations (left, right)

Please refer to the paper for details on dataset construction and splits.
